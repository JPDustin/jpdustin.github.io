            <h2>An Important Message to Members</h2>
            <p>We want to bring to your attention some significant challenges that have arisen during our recent
                outreach efforts. As you know, our campaign is dedicated to fostering a fair and democratic environment
                within our union. However, during our visits to various sites, we have encountered deliberate resistance
                and barriers orchestrated by the current Local 633 leadership that hinder our ability to connect with
                all of you.</p>
            <p>For example, during our visit to UPS Nashua, we spent nearly an hour in designated areas on the
                property. Shortly after our arrival, it appears that a member of the current
                Local 633 leadership was contacted. We were told that this "agent" then reached out to upper management,
                who in
                turn instructed the center manager that we were not allowed on the property. Despite following proper
                protocols and being in designated areas, we were forced to leave after the division manager was directed
                to remove us.</p>
            <p>At First Student Nashua, we were met with hostility from the site manager, who informed us that we were
                not welcome. It seems likely that he had been alerted in advance to be on the lookout for us, further
                restricting our ability to connect with members.</p>

            <p>
                At Bimbo Bakeries in Wilmington, MA, a significant number of the current Local 633 leadership were
                present on-site, despite the fact that some locations represented by the local have not seen visits from
                leadership in quite some time. Not only were they present, but some of them also directly confronted us.
                Their presence and confrontations at this particular site were telling, suggesting a coordinated effort
                to monitor and suppress our outreach. This is particularly concerning, as it raises questions about
                where their priorities lie and why they chose this moment to appear in force, especially given their
                absence from other locations.
            </p>
            <p>In another incident at UPS Twin Mountain, a member of the current Local 633 leadership arrived
                unannounced
                at the facility and took actions to undermine our campaign by removing or instructing our materials be
                removed and instructing others not to distribute campaign-related flyers. These actions are not only
                undemocratic but also serve to silence the voices of those seeking to bring about positive change within
                our union.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these challenges and the clear attempts by the current Local 633 leadership to block our
                efforts, we remain resolute in our mission. We believe that every member has the right to hear our
                message and participate fully in the democratic process. We urge you to stay informed, ask questions,
                and stand with us in promoting transparency, fairness, and the ability for all voices to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your support is crucial in ensuring that our union remains strong and united. Together, we can overcome
                these obstacles and continue to work towards a better future for all members.
