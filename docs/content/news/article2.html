                <h2>President Biden Secures Pensions for 70,000 New England
                    Teamsters, Saving Retirement Futures</h2>
                <p class="news-date">July 30, 2024</p>
                <p>
                    In a significant victory for American workers, President Joe Biden announced the safeguarding of
                    pensions for over 600,000 Teamster workers and retirees, including 70,000 individuals in New England
                    and 6,000 beneficiaries in New Hampshire alone. This announcement underscores the Biden
                    Administration's commitment to protecting the financial futures of hardworking Americans.

                    Before the enactment of the American Rescue Plan, many multiemployer pension funds were on the brink
                    of insolvency. The Central States Pension Fund, for instance, was only 14.5% funded and faced
                    imminent collapse. Without intervention, this would have resulted in severe cuts to the pensions of
                    hundreds of thousands of retirees, with some facing reductions of up to 60% <a

                    The American Rescue Plan, passed in 2021 without any Republican support, included provisions that
                    prevented these devastating cuts by injecting $36 billion into the Central States Pension Fund and
                    other struggling pension plans. This historic bailout, the largest of its kind, has since restored
                    the fund to a healthy status, now 97.5% funded, securing the pensions of millions of Americans​ <a

                    In New England, the rescue plan has provided critical financial security to thousands of Teamsters.
                    President Biden, alongside Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, emphasized the importance of
                    this move for the region’s workers. The funds ensure that retirees who had spent decades
                    contributing to their pensions can now look forward to a dignified retirement without fear of
                    financial instability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The successful turnaround of these pension funds highlights the administration's broader efforts to
                    strengthen the American economy and protect workers' rights. By securing the pensions of Teamsters
                    in New England and across the country, President Biden has delivered on his promise to support
                    American workers and their families.
