                <h4>Vice-President</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>Robert "Bobby" Browne is a dedicated second-generation Union member with 25 years as a proud
                    Teamster. Born into a Union household, Bobby's commitment to union values is deeply rooted. His
                    father has been a member of the National Education Association (NEA) for 36 years, and his
                    mother has served 21 years with both the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).</p>
                <p>In 1999, Bobby was hired by UPS in Twin Mountain, NH. He soon became an Alternate Steward at UPS
                    in Laconia, NH, and was elected Steward in 2018, a position he currently holds at the UPS
                    Northfield, NH facility. Bobby has also volunteered his free time with the Lakes Region Disabled
                    Sports Program at Gunstock Ski Area.</p>
                <p>Bobby's extensive experience in battling and advocating within one of the toughest companies,
                    UPS, has made him a valuable asset to the members he represents daily. He believes his skills
                    and unwavering determination will benefit all members of Local 633 when the 633 Teamsters Power
                    Slate is elected.</p>
                <p>Bobby has felt disappointment with the current Local Union's representation, feeling there has
                    been a marked decline in effectiveness over the past three years. He feels that the current
                    leadership has been focusing more on prioritizing relationships with management rather than
                    fighting for members' rights, often settling short and leaving members uninformed. Bobby
                    emphasizes the importance of an engaged and active membership for achieving better results.</p>
                <p>When elected, Bobby pledges to ensure that no member is left behind, advocating for a union that
                    truly represents and fights for its members' rights.</p>

            <h4>Business Agent</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Anthony "Tony" Dionne is a dedicated 25-year member of Teamster Local 633. He began his career
                with UPS in Keene, NH, in 1999 as a driver, consistently supporting his fellow drivers and
                volunteering his time. Tony has served as a duly elected driver Shop Steward at the UPS Keene
                facility and is now a full-time Shop Steward on the UPS Keene preload. His extensive experience
                in advocating for members and successfully challenging UPS management has equipped him with the
                skills necessary to represent his colleagues effectively.</p>
            <p>In addition to his union work, Tony believes in giving back to the community. He founded and led
                a nonprofit organization for youth basketball, AAU, from 2018 to 2020. He also volunteered in
                the fight to defeat the "Right to Work for Less" legislation in New Hampshire in 2021 and served
                as the secretary on the board of his nonprofit church.</p>
            <p>Tony is running for Union Business Agent on the 633 Teamsters Power Slate because he believes
                that members need strong representation both in the office and at the arbitration and
                negotiation tables. He is committed to ensuring that elected representatives prioritize the
                members' interests over maintaining friendly relationships with management. Tony is critical of
                the current administration, which he believes is more interested in collecting dues than
                fighting for members' rights.</p>
            <p>Tony has a proven track record of advocating for members' rights and is eager to continue this
                work with even greater intensity if elected. He promises to be a strong voice for members during
                negotiations, arbitrations, and in the office. Unlike some who may have been appointed due to
                family or friends, Tony has earned his position through hard work and dedication.</p>
            <p>Tony assures members that they will receive timely responses and support, with no delays or
                unreturned calls. He pledges to provide a positive return on members' investment by being a
                reliable and effective representative who truly fights for their rights and interests.</p>

            <h4>Business Agent</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Steven Gaines is running for the position of Business Agent for Local 633, bringing a deep
                commitment to hard work, dedication, and community. Raised in Seminole, FL, Steven learned these
                values early on. Family is the cornerstone of his life; he has been happily married to his wife,
                Kristina, since 2018, and together they have three amazing children who inspire him every day.
            </p>
            <p>Steven began his career with UPS in 2018 and quickly advanced to a driving role at the Twin
                Mountain location in 2019. His commitment to his colleagues and passion for fair treatment in
                the workplace led him to become a steward in 2021. As a steward, Steven consistently stepped up
                to advocate for employees' rights and interests when they sought his assistance with contract
                and work issues.</p>
            <p>Steven's decision to run for Business Agent stems from deep dissatisfaction with the current
                leadership's approach to handling member concerns. He is a proud member of the Power Slate, a
                coalition of UPS stewards and rank-and-file members dedicated to empowering the members of Local
                633. The Power Slate's mission is to restore the union's influence and strength, ensuring that
                every member's voice is heard and respected.</p>
            <p>Steven brings a wealth of qualities to his candidacy: resilience, hard work, dedication,
                reliability, compassion, trustworthiness, and self-awareness. These attributes have guided him
                throughout his career and will continue to drive his efforts to bring about positive change for
                union members.</p>
            <p>Steven is committed to building a stronger, more responsive union that truly represents the needs
                and aspirations of its members. He pledges to be a Business Agent who listens, acts, and
                delivers for Local 633, ensuring that every member receives the support and representation they
                deserve.</p>

                <p>Timothy Merrill is a dedicated Teamster with 31 years of experience. Married to his wife,
                    Jennifer, for 26 years, they have two wonderful children, Tyler and Lauren.</p>
                <p>Timothy has worked as a driver at the UPS MHT Gateway, UPS Keene facility, and UPS Manchester
                    facility. He has served as both an Alternate Shop Steward and Shop Steward, actively fighting
                    for members' rights daily. Timothy has also contributed to the Safety Committee and the
                    Mentoring Committee, where he educates new drivers on the principles of being a good Teamster
                    and an effective driver. His community involvement includes raising money for Meals on Wheels,
                    volunteering with Liberty House for veterans, and participating in the Touch-A-Truck initiative.
                </p>
                <p>Running on the 633 Teamsters Power Slate, comprised of rank-and-file Teamsters, Timothy believes

                    status quo of non-responses and excuses that prioritize companies over members. Timothy
                    advocates for strong representation at every workplace, at the bargaining table, and on the

            <h4>Trustee</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Robert "Bob" Stanley has been a dedicated UPS driver since 2000. Starting his career in the Nashua
                building, he bid into the Manchester facility in 2006 to be closer to home and to have more time
                to coach his three sons' football teams. In 2011, he relocated to the Lakes Region and
                subsequently bid into the Laconia building in 2012, further reducing his commute and allowing
                for more family time.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Bob was elected as the alternate steward for the Laconia building, a position he
                continues to hold at the new Northfield facility. His tenure as an alternate steward has
                highlighted the need for stronger representation of 633 members. Bob has observed a
                disconnect in the chain of command, with the current slate often falling short in member
                representation. He notes that they appear more accommodating to management, settling grievances
                for less than members deserve or not settling them at all. This lack of effective representation
                is why Bob has decided to join the 633 Teamsters Power Slate campaign.</p>
            <p>As a father of six, Bob values the benefits and pay that his job at UPS has provided, ensuring
                good medical and dental care for his family and the financial means to support them. He is
                committed to ensuring that all members continue to receive the benefits and pay they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>Bob believes that all members deserve equal representation. He prioritizes assisting the
                current acting steward in keeping members informed of their rights and responsibilities as
                active union members. He has thoroughly familiarized himself with all contracts and actively
                encourages other members to do the same, believing that knowledge is power.</p>
            <p>If elected as Trustee, Bob pledges to continue fighting for the rights of each member and to
                work productively with other slate members to keep the union running efficiently. He is
                committed to ensuring that no member is left behind and that the union effectively represents
                and supports all its members.</p>
