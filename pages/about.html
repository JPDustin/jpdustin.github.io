                    <h4>President</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="bio-right col-md-8">
                    <p>James "Jim" Marchand is a first-generation Teamster who has always aspired to work as a truck driver. In 2006, he left his 11-year job as a delivery driver at A.H. Notini & Sons in Lowell, MA, to pursue his dream. He enrolled in NETTS in Andover, MA, to obtain his CDL A license. Upon receiving his license, Jim began applying for jobs and, in July 2006, received an offer from UPS Freight in Londonderry, NH, as a local pickup and delivery driver. He was officially hired in August 2006 and played a role in endorsing the first-ever Teamster Contract at UPS Freight, which was ratified in July 2008. Since joining the Teamsters Union, Jim has been an active member, supporting various stewards over the years and attending monthly union meetings. He has also worked with Local 633 to defeat the Right to Work bill.</p>
                    <p>In December 2018, when Steward Roger Martineau retired, Jim reached out to his business agent, Kevin Foley, to express his intention to run for Shop Steward. He was duly elected and has spent many years working closely with Kevin and the union. Jim is well-versed in the grievance and panel process and has co-presented and won numerous precedent-setting arbitration cases, resulting in significant payouts for members. He has been a key witness in many transformative cases during his tenure as a steward for UPS Freight and T-Force Freight.</p>
                    <p>Jim believes that Local 633 needs to move in a new direction where members feel supported and empowered by their union leaders when dealing with employers. He emphasizes the importance of member involvement for the success of the Local and criticizes the current administration for failing to represent its members adequately. Jim advocates for a responsive and proactive union, ensuring that no member feels abandoned. He pledges to represent the membership of Local 633 with honesty, integrity, and transparency.</p>
                    <p>Jim has been happily married to his wife, Christina, for 25 years. They have three children: Tyler (24), Trevor (21), and Megan (15). Tyler and Trevor are active Local 633 members working as delivery drivers at Bimbo Bakeries in Wilmington, MA. Jim enjoys cooking and BBQing for his family and friends, and he has a passion for automotive activities, including racing, car shows, and working on his 1986 Mercury Capri. Family is a significant part of his life, and he cherishes spending his free time with his wife and children.</p>

                    <p>Robert "Bobby" Browne is a dedicated second-generation Union member with 25 years as a proud Teamster. Born into a Union household, Bobby's commitment to union values is deeply rooted. His father has been a member of the National Education Association (NEA) for 36 years, and his mother has served 21 years with both the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).</p>
                    <p>In 1999, Bobby was hired by UPS in Twin Mountain, NH. He soon became an Alternate Steward at UPS in Laconia, NH, and was elected Steward in 2018, a position he currently holds at the UPS Northfield, NH facility. Bobby has also volunteered his free time with the Lakes Region Disabled Sports Program at Gunstock Ski Area.</p>
                    <p>Bobby's extensive experience in battling and advocating within one of the toughest companies, UPS, has made him a valuable asset to the members he represents daily. He believes his skills and unwavering determination will benefit all members of Local 633 when the 633 Teamsters Powerslate is elected.</p>
                    <p>Bobby expresses disappointment with the current Local Union's representation, citing a decline in effectiveness over the past three years. He criticizes the current leadership for prioritizing relationships with management over fighting for members' rights, often settling short and leaving members uninformed. Bobby emphasizes the importance of an engaged and active membership for achieving better results.</p>
                    <p>When elected, Bobby pledges to ensure that no member is left behind, advocating for a union that truly represents and fights for its members' rights.</p>

                    <p>Timothy Merrill is a dedicated Teamster with 31 years of experience. Married to his wife, Jennifer, for 26 years, they have two wonderful children, Tyler and Lauren.</p>

                    <p>Robert Stanley has been a dedicated UPS driver since 2000. Starting his career in the Nashua building, he bid into the Manchester facility in 2006 to be closer to home and to have more time to coach his three sons' football teams. In 2011, he relocated to the Lakes Region and subsequently bid into the Laconia building in 2012, further reducing his commute and allowing for more family time.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, Robert was elected as the alternate steward for the Laconia building, a position he continues to hold at the new Northfield facility. His tenure as an alternate steward has highlighted the need for stronger representation of 633 members. Robert has observed a disconnect in the chain of command, with the current slate often falling short in member representation. He notes that they appear more accommodating to management, settling grievances for less than members deserve or not settling them at all. This lack of effective representation is why Robert has decided to join the 633 Teamsters Powerslate campaign.</p>
                    <p>As a father of six, Robert values the benefits and pay that his job at UPS has provided, ensuring good medical and dental care for his family and the financial means to support them. He is committed to ensuring that all members continue to receive the benefits and pay they deserve.</p>
                    <p>Robert believes that all members deserve equal representation. He prioritizes assisting the current acting steward in keeping members informed of their rights and responsibilities as active union members. He has thoroughly familiarized himself with all contracts and actively encourages other members to do the same, believing that knowledge is power.</p>
                    <p>If elected as Trustee, Robert pledges to continue fighting for the rights of each member and to work productively with other slate members to keep the union running efficiently. He is committed to ensuring that no member is left behind and that the union effectively represents and supports all its members.</p>
