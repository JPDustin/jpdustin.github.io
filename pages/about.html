                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        James "Jim" Marchand is a first-generation Teamster who has always aspired to work as a truck
                        driver. In 2006, he left his 11-year job as a delivery driver at A.H. Notini & Sons in Lowell,
                        MA, to pursue his dream. He enrolled in NETTS in Andover, MA, to obtain his CDL A license. Upon
                        receiving his license, Jim began applying for jobs and, in July 2006, received an offer from UPS
                        Freight in Londonderry, NH, as a local pickup and delivery driver. He was officially hired in
                        August 2006 and played a role in endorsing the first-ever Teamster Contract at UPS Freight,
                        which was ratified in July 2008. Since joining the Teamsters Union, Jim has been an active
                        member, supporting various stewards over the years and attending monthly union meetings. He has
                        also worked with Local 633 to defeat the Right to Work bill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        In December 2018, when Steward Roger Martineau retired, Jim reached out to his business agent,
                        Kevin Foley, to express his intention to run for Shop Steward. He was duly elected and has spent
                        many years working closely with Kevin and the union. Jim is well-versed in the grievance and
                        panel process and has co-presented and won numerous precedent-setting arbitration cases,
                        resulting in significant payouts for members. He has been a key witness in many transformative
                        cases during his tenure as a steward for UPS Freight and T-Force Freight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Jim believes that Local 633 needs to move in a new direction where members feel supported and
                        empowered by their union leaders when dealing with employers. He emphasizes the importance of
                        member involvement for the success of the Local and criticizes the current administration for
                        failing to represent its members adequately. Jim advocates for a responsive and proactive union,
                        ensuring that no member feels abandoned. He pledges to represent the membership of Local 633
                        with honesty, integrity, and transparency.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Jim has been happily married to his wife, Christina, for 25 years. They have three children:
                        Tyler (24), Trevor (21), and Megan (15). Tyler and Trevor are active Local 633 members working
                        as delivery drivers at Bimbo Bakeries in Wilmington, MA. Jim enjoys cooking and BBQing for his
                        family and friends, and he has a passion for automotive activities, including racing, car shows,
                        and working on his 1986 Mercury Capri. Family is a significant part of his life, and he
                        cherishes spending his free time with his wife and children.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Robert "Bob" Stanley has been a dedicated UPS driver since 2000. Starting his career in the
                        Nashua building, he bid into the Manchester facility in 2006 to be closer to home and to have
                        more time to coach his three sons' football teams. In 2011, he relocated to the Lakes Region and
                        subsequently bid into the Laconia building in 2012, further reducing his commute and allowing
                        for more family time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        In 2018, Bob was elected as the alternate steward for the Laconia building, a position he
                        continues to hold at the new Northfield facility. His tenure as an alternate steward has
                        highlighted the need for stronger representation of 633 members. Bob has observed a disconnect
                        in the chain of command, with the current slate often falling short in member representation. He
                        notes that they appear more accommodating to management, settling grievances for less than
                        members deserve or not settling them at all. This lack of effective representation is why Bob
                        has decided to join the 633 Teamsters Power Slate campaign.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        As a father of six, Bob values the benefits and pay that his job at UPS has provided, ensuring
                        good medical and dental care for his family and the financial means to support them. He is
                        committed to ensuring that all members continue to receive the benefits and pay they deserve.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Bob believes that all members deserve equal representation. He prioritizes assisting the current
                        acting steward in keeping members informed of their rights and responsibilities as active union
                        members. He has thoroughly familiarized himself with all contracts and actively encourages other
                        members to do the same, believing that knowledge is power.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        If elected as VP, Bob pledges to continue fighting for the rights of each member and to
                        work productively with other slate members to keep the union running efficiently. He is
                        committed to ensuring that no member is left behind and that the union effectively represents
                        and supports all its members.

                        with UPS in Keene, NH, in 1999 as a driver, consistently supporting his fellow drivers and
                        volunteering his time. Tony has served as a duly elected driver Shop Steward at the UPS Keene

                        commitment to hard work, dedication, and community. Raised in Seminole, FL, Steven learned these
                        values early on. Family is the cornerstone of his life; he has been happily married to his wife,
                        Kristina, since 2018, and together they have three amazing children who inspire him every day.

                        Mountain location in 2019. His commitment to his colleagues and passion for fair treatment in
                        the workplace led him to become a steward in 2021. As a steward, Steven consistently stepped up
                        to advocate for employees' rights and interests when they sought his assistance with contract
                        and work issues.

                        coalition of UPS stewards and rank-and-file members dedicated to empowering the members of Local
                        633. The Power Slate's mission is to restore the union's influence and strength, ensuring that

                        Cristian Ionescu is a naturalized American citizen of Romanian origin who came to the United
                        States in 2000 as a seaman. After deciding to pursue a different career on land, Cristian moved
                        to Boston and worked in the restaurant industry, eventually obtaining sponsorship for his path
                        toward citizenship. He graduated from NTTS in Pawtucket, RI, and earned his CDL in
                        Massachusetts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        In 2004, Cristian began his career as a truck driver with Old Dominion. A year later, he joined
                        Overnite/UPS Freight/TForce, becoming a first-generation union member. He has since worked
                        between Local 633 and Local 25 and, for the past two years, has been with ABF Freight in
                        Londonderry, NH.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Cristian and his wife made significant sacrifices in their pursuit of becoming naturalized
                        citizens, a process that took nearly seven years. Their goal was to achieve freedom and
                        prosperity, much like other first-generation immigrant families. Cristian is deeply thankful for
                        the opportunities that have allowed them to become an integral part of American society.
                        With over 1.5 million miles logged as a road driver, Cristian has extensive experience as both a
                        dock worker and city driver. He understands the daily challenges faced by his fellow union

                        Cristian believes it is essential to remember who we are and why we are here. He emphasizes that
                        union members do not work for the union; rather, they are the union. He is critical of what he
                        perceives as the repeated failures of entitled union representatives and backdoor deals made at
                        the expense of members.

                        livelihoods of union members and their families. He believes that union members are responsible
