                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        James "Jim" Marchand is a first-generation Teamster who has always aspired to work as a truck
                        driver. In 2006, he left his 11-year job as a delivery driver at A.H. Notini & Sons in Lowell,
                        MA, to pursue his dream. He enrolled in NETTS in Andover, MA, to obtain his CDL A license. Upon
                        receiving his license, Jim began applying for jobs and, in July 2006, received an offer from UPS
                        Freight in Londonderry, NH, as a local pickup and delivery driver. He was officially hired in
                        August 2006 and played a role in endorsing the first-ever Teamster Contract at UPS Freight,
                        which was ratified in July 2008. Since joining the Teamsters Union, Jim has been an active
                        member, supporting various stewards over the years and attending monthly union meetings. He has
                        also worked with Local 633 to defeat the Right to Work bill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        In December 2018, when Steward Roger Martineau retired, Jim reached out to his business agent,
                        Kevin Foley, to express his intention to run for Shop Steward. He was duly elected and has spent
                        many years working closely with Kevin and the union. Jim is well-versed in the grievance and
                        panel process and has co-presented and won numerous precedent-setting arbitration cases,
                        resulting in significant payouts for members. He has been a key witness in many transformative
                        cases during his tenure as a steward for UPS Freight and T-Force Freight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Jim believes that Local 633 needs to move in a new direction where members feel supported and
                        empowered by their union leaders when dealing with employers. He emphasizes the importance of
                        member involvement for the success of the Local and criticizes the current administration for
                        failing to represent its members adequately. Jim advocates for a responsive and proactive union,
                        ensuring that no member feels abandoned. He pledges to represent the membership of Local 633
                        with honesty, integrity, and transparency.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Jim has been happily married to his wife, Christina, for 25 years. They have three children:
                        Tyler (24), Trevor (21), and Megan (15). Tyler and Trevor are active Local 633 members working
                        as delivery drivers at Bimbo Bakeries in Wilmington, MA. Jim enjoys cooking and BBQing for his
                        family and friends, and he has a passion for automotive activities, including racing, car shows,
                        and working on his 1986 Mercury Capri. Family is a significant part of his life, and he
                        cherishes spending his free time with his wife and children.

                        volunteering his time. Tony has served as a duly elected driver Shop Steward at the UPS Keene

                        Timothy Merrill is a dedicated Teamster with 31 years of experience. Married to his wife,
                        Jennifer, for 26 years, they have two wonderful children, Tyler and Lauren.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Timothy has worked as a driver at the UPS MHT Gateway, UPS Keene facility, and UPS Manchester
                        facility. He has served as both an Alternate Shop Steward and Shop Steward, actively fighting
                        for members' rights daily. Timothy has also contributed to the Safety Committee and the
                        Mentoring Committee, where he educates new drivers on the principles of being a good Teamster
                        and an effective driver. His community involvement includes raising money for Meals on Wheels,
                        volunteering with Liberty House for veterans, and participating in the Touch-A-Truck initiative.

                        Running on the 633 Teamsters Power Slate, comprised of rank-and-file Teamsters, Timothy believes
                        it is time to elect genuine representation that fights for members' rights. He opposes the
                        status quo of non-responses and excuses that prioritize companies over members. Timothy
                        advocates for strong representation at every workplace, at the bargaining table, and on the
                        picket lines, aiming to unify and empower members.

                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Robert "Bob" Stanley has been a dedicated UPS driver since 2000. Starting his career in the
                        Nashua building, he bid into the Manchester facility in 2006 to be closer to home and to have
                        more time to coach his three sons' football teams. In 2011, he relocated to the Lakes Region and
                        subsequently bid into the Laconia building in 2012, further reducing his commute and allowing
                        for more family time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        In 2018, Bob was elected as the alternate steward for the Laconia building, a position he
                        continues to hold at the new Northfield facility. His tenure as an alternate steward has
                        highlighted the need for stronger representation of 633 members. Bob has observed a disconnect
                        in the chain of command, with the current slate often falling short in member representation. He
                        notes that they appear more accommodating to management, settling grievances for less than
                        members deserve or not settling them at all. This lack of effective representation is why Bob
                        has decided to join the 633 Teamsters Power Slate campaign.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        As a father of six, Bob values the benefits and pay that his job at UPS has provided, ensuring
                        good medical and dental care for his family and the financial means to support them. He is
                        committed to ensuring that all members continue to receive the benefits and pay they deserve.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        Bob believes that all members deserve equal representation. He prioritizes assisting the current
                        acting steward in keeping members informed of their rights and responsibilities as active union
                        members. He has thoroughly familiarized himself with all contracts and actively encourages other
                        members to do the same, believing that knowledge is power.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us__description">
                        If elected as Trustee, Bob pledges to continue fighting for the rights of each member and to
                        work productively with other slate members to keep the union running efficiently. He is
                        committed to ensuring that no member is left behind and that the union effectively represents
                        and supports all its members.

                        It was at UPS Freight that Jeff joined Teamsters Local 633, thanks to Shop Steward Jim Marchand,

                        clerk drive. Jeff is proud to be a Teamster and is currently an OS&D Clerk at TForce Freight in
